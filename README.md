Face Verification Using Siamese Neural Network
 1. Introduction
This project implements a Siamese Neural Network for face verification, inspired by the research paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" by Koch et al. It learns a similarity metric between face pairs and is designed to work well in one-shot learning scenarios, generalizing to new, unseen identities without retraining.

 2. Problem Statement
Traditional Face Recognition Limitations:
Requires large labeled datasets.

Needs retraining for new identities.

 Objective:
To verify whether two face images belong to the same person using a Siamese Neural Network, even with limited data.

 3. Dataset
